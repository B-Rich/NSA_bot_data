# NSA_bot_data

## WebApp/MongoDB to go along with NSABot's collected data

### Installation:
- Install mongoDB, node, and npm
- As a side note, I recommend installing npm through nvm (node version manager)
- Run npm install
- Run mongod (mongoDB daemon process -- basically hosts the db). Note: the DB will be hosted locally usually on port 27017.
- Run mongo (command-line shell that connects to a specific instance of mongod)
- Run node app.js (this will start the server on port 5000)
- Go to localhost:5000
